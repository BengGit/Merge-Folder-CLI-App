# Merge-Folder-CLI-App
A CLI tool that merges two folders together.

When faced with the issue of Windows Explorer crashing when merging folders with a large number of files (50k+/folder), I decided that a CLI app would be more stable and consistent than the built in Explorer. This app will be built with stability in mind and not speed nor efficiency.
